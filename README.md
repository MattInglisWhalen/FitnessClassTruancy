!["Support Vector Machine Regression Importances"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattInglisWhalen/FitnessClassTruancy/main/images/svm_importance.png "SVM Importances")

This repository is a record of the exam for the Associate Data Scientist certification on DataCamp. The data is synthetic and was produced solely for the purpose of the exam. 

The interactive python notebook [fitness_class_truancy.ipynb](https://github.com/MattInglisWhalen/FitnessClassTruancy/blob/main/fitness_class_truancy.ipynb) 
performs cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modelling for data regarding classes held at a fictional fitness studio. Various
feature columns include months as a member, member weight, and class type, with the target variable being whether or not the member will attend a class that they have signed up for.
The goal of the project was to predict from the feature columns whether or not a member would actually attend their class. Both models studied -- a Logistic Regression 
model and a Support Vector Machine -- achieved a `balanced accuracy` of ~75%.
